## IUPAC Nomenclature

## Introduction
Hi everyone, My name is Hardik Mahajan.
I got a very good opportunity to test my knowledge on HTML5 and CSS through my college project in first year.
My chemistry project of building a basic website on topic: IUPAC Nomenclature, which had the basics about naming a hydrocarbon.
Initially I was totally blank because this was the first time I was buiding a hands-on project without a tutorial and hence I have to search each and every bit myself.
But later, as started the process I got used to it, and started making my first ever project look atleast descent.
I used google fonts and color palettes to get me started and getting some data about IUPAC to paste on my website.
And finally after a 2-day sitting, I completed my project which felt to me like a milestone. I had never sat like that so much making me feel more like a co-orporate employee!
Although my website was very basic but it was the entry-door for me to step in the development world, teaching me about basic skills that we need as a developer.
