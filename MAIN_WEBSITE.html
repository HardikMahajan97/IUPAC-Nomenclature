      <h3>Nomenclature in Chemistry</h3>
      Nomenclature in chemistry refers to the system of naming chemical compounds based on specific rules and conventions established by various chemical organizations, most notably the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Proper naming is crucial in chemistry to ensure clear communication about the identity and structure of a compound.
      There are several key aspects of nomenclature, including:
      <br>
      <h3>Organic Nomenclature:</h3>
      Organic compounds are primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, often with additional elements like oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, etc. Organic nomenclature is particularly important due to the vast diversity of organic compounds.
      Common naming systems include IUPAC names, systematic names, and common names.
      <br>
      <h3>IUPAC Nomenclature:</h3>
      
      The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is the global authority responsible for standardizing chemical nomenclature. They establish rules for naming organic, inorganic, and coordination compounds.
      IUPAC names are systematic and follow a specific set of guidelines. For example, in organic compounds, the longest continuous carbon chain is identified as the parent chain, and substituents are named based on their position relative to the parent chain.
      <br>

      <h3>Inorganic Nomenclature:</h3>
      
      Inorganic compounds include salts, metals, minerals, and other non-carbon-based compounds. IUPAC also provides guidelines for naming inorganic compounds.
      For example, cations (positively charged ions) are typically named after the metal, while anions (negatively charged ions) are named by replacing the ending of the element's name with "-ide" (e.g., chloride, oxide).
      <br>

      <h3>Functional Group Nomenclature:</h3>
      
      Functional groups are specific arrangements of atoms within molecules that confer characteristic chemical properties to the compound. Naming compounds with functional groups involves identifying and naming these groups according to IUPAC rules.
      <br>

      Trivial or common names are non-systematic names that have been traditionally used for certain compounds. While they are still widely used, IUPAC names are preferred for accuracy and consistency.
      <br>
    
      <h3>Isomer Nomenclature:</h3>
      
      Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements or spatial orientation. They are named to reflect these differences, such as structural isomers, geometric isomers, and optical isomers.
      <br>
      <h3>Stereochemistry and Configuration:</h3>
      
      Stereochemistry deals with the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. It includes terms like "cis" and "trans" for geometric isomers and "R" and "S" configurations for chiral compounds.
      <br>

      <h3>Coordination Complex Nomenclature:</h3>
        Coordination compounds involve metal atoms or ions linked by coordinate bonds to ligands (molecules or ions that donate electrons). IUPAC provides specific rules for naming these compounds.
